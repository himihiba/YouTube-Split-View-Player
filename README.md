# YouTube Split-View Player
## Overview
I often use YouTube while studying, learning new concepts, or following tutorials. However, I found it frustrating that YouTube either takes up the entire screen in fullscreen mode or remains too small with wasted black space when resized. I wasn't sure if there was a built-in solution, so instead of searching, I decided to code my own.

This project allows for a more efficient split-screen experience by enabling a properly resized YouTube player that works with both single videos and playlists. While I didnâ€™t initially plan to publish it, I found myself using it every time I opened my computer, so I thoughtâ€”why not add it to my list of projects?
## Features  
âœ… Supports **single videos** and **playlists**  
âœ… **Resizable split-screen view** without wasted space  
âœ… **Popup mode** for distraction-free watching  
âœ… Simple and functionalâ€”**focus on usability over aesthetics** 

It might not have the most polished UI, but it does exactly what I needâ€”and thatâ€™s what matters most.
